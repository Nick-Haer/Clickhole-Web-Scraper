## Overview

Looking for a laugh? This app is a web scraper targeting the joke news site Clickhole, giving users the option to save articles to a database, and then add notes to them. Simply click the "Scrape" button to show up all new clickhole articles. From the home page, you can see a title and brief summary of each article. You can also follow a link to the article itself. If you like one of them, you can save them to the database, add your thoughts, and then view all saved articles under the "saved" page.
